A game where you collect items, except the game automatically quits when you collect them all.
A key in one game unlocks a door in a completely separate game.

Press U to surrender
A button you press to stop the chaos, that doesn't work

Read an enemy's emails to learn how to beat them
You are the queen, dusting your jewellery while your kingdom is destroyed.
You must address and rally a group of eager press reporters

You start in a small room, until you realize you can just walk through the walls.
You walk around talking people down from pursuing their hopes or dreams.
